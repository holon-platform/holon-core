# Holon platform Core module

This is the __core__ module of the [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) and represents the platform foundation, providing the definition of the overall architecture, base structures and APIs.

See the module [documentation](https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference/holon-core.html) for details.

Just like any other platform module, this artifact is part of the [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) ecosystem, but can be also used as a _stand-alone_ library.

See the [platform documentation](https://docs.holon-platform.com/current/reference) for further details.

## Code structure

See [Holon Platform code structure and conventions](https://github.com/holon-platform/platform/blob/master/CODING.md) to learn about the _"real Java API"_ philosophy with which the project codebase is developed and organized.

## Getting started

### System requirements

The Holon Platform is built using __Java 8__, so you need a JRE/JDK version 8 or above to use the platform artifacts.

### Releases

See [releases](https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-core/releases) for the available releases. Each release tag provides a link to the closed issues.

### Obtain the artifacts

The Maven __group id__ for this module is `com.holon-platform.core` and a _BOM (Bill of Materials)_ is provided to obtain the module artifacts:

_Maven BOM:_
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
        <artifactId>holon-bom</artifactId>
        <version>5.0.6</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>

### Using the Platform BOM

The [Holon Platform](https://holon-platform.com) provides an overall Maven _BOM (Bill of Materials)_ to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts:

_Platform Maven BOM:_
```xml
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.holon-platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>bom</artifactId>
        <version>${platform-version}</version>
        <type>pom</type>
        <scope>import</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencyManagement>
```

See the [Artifacts list](#artifacts-list) for a list of the available artifacts of this module.

### Build from sources

You can build the sources using Maven (version 3.3.x or above is recommended) like this: 

`mvn clean install`
