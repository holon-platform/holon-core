[[Datastore]]
=== Datastore

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/Datastore.html[Datastore^] API is the main entry point to manage data access and persistence in a technology/platform/vendor independent way.

The `Datastore` data management strategy relies on the Holon platform <<Property, property model>> architecture to represent and manage data model attributes in a generic and implementation-independent way, using the  <<PropertyBox>> structure as data interchange carrier between the `Datastore` API and the concrete data model.

A concrete `Datastore` implementation could provide a more specialized API, with functionalities expressly related to the specific persistence technology/model.

We'll refer to an _entity_ in this documentation as a generic persistence model data container. An _entity_ may be for example a _table_ in a RDBMS context, a _JPA entity class_ in a JPA environment or a _document_ in a document based data store.

The `Datastore` API provides the following operations:

* *Refresh:* Refresh the data of a data model _entity_, retrieving the most updated version.
* *Insert:* Insert a new data model _entity_ into the persistence store.
* *Update:* Update a data model _entity_ already present in the persistence store.
* *Save:* Insert or update a data model _entity_, depending on the existence of the _entity_ itself in the persistence store.
* *Bulk* operations definition and execution (`bulkInsert`, `bulkUpdate` and `bulkDelete`): to execute batch operations in the persistence store.
* *Query definition and execution*: to configure and execute _queries_ against the persistence store, allowing to declare query results restrictions, aggregations and sorting and to obtain the query results using different _projections_.

Each operation which involves a possible persistence store data modification returns an `OperationResult` type object, which provides information about the operation outcome, such as the number of the elements affected by the execution of the operation or the _auto-generated_ key values, if the concrete persistence store supports this feature.

[[ExpressionResolver]]
==== Expressions and resolvers

The `Datastore` API architecture is designed on top of the Holon platform link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/Expression.html[Expression^] based architecture.

An `Expression` is a very abstract and generic representation of an element of a language. The `Datastore` API uses _expressions_ to "translate" a meta-language into the actual language which can be understood by the concrete persistense context engine to which the `Datastore` is bound. 

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/ExpressionResolver.html[ExpressionResolver^] interface is the key element to perform the language manipulation and translation, since it is used to _resolve_ an `Expression` type into another `Expression` type.

An `ExpressionResolver` declares the expression type which is able to process, and the expression type which provides as resolution result. An `ExpressionResolver` can return an empty `Optional` if it is not able to resolve given expression: this way, the resultion process must proceed to the next available resolver for given expression and resolution type.

A generic `ResolutionContext` object is provided to the `ExpressionResolver` resolution method, to provide information about the current resolution context.

A set of `ExpressionResolver` can be handled using an link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/ExpressionResolverRegistry.html[ExpressionResolverRegistry^]. When an `Expression` must be resolved, all the available resolvers which declare to resolve the given expression type and provide a consistent resolution type will be taken into account. These resolvers are invoked sequentially, 
returning the first valid resolved expression, if any.

To order the expression resolvers with the same expression types, the `javax.annotation.Priority` annotation can be used on the `ExpressionResolver` implementation class to assign a priority order, where lower values corresponds to higher priority.

The `Datastore` API , extending the `ExpressionResolverSupport` interface, supports the registration of new `ExpressionResolver` instances. This is the recommended way to implement `Datastore` *extensions* and persistence operations *customization*.

Since a `Datastore` implementation can be bound to very different data models and persistence context, each expression resolution strategy is highly dependent from the concrete `Datastore` implementation, including a possibly specialized version of the `ResolutionContext`. See each concrete `Datastore` implementation documentation to learn about the `ExpressionResolver` support and the available expression types which can be used for extensibility purposes.

Anyway, the core meta-language expressions set is common to any `Datastore` implementation. For this reason, it is possible to provide `Datastore` API extensions in a general and implementation independent way using the `ExpressionResolver` based strategy when the expression resolution is bound to the standard meta-language expressions.

Most of the standard `Datastore` operations (for example the <<Query>> operation) support `ExpressionResolver` registration, to provide expression resolution manipulation only for a specific operation execution. 

See the <<DatastoreExtension>> section for details.

==== Property data types

The `Datastore` API fully supports *property values conversions* using the standard <<PropertyValueConverter,property value converter>> API. If a `Property` declares a value converter, it will be used to perform conversions from the property type to the data model attribute type and back. 

A converter can be used to adapt specific data types, to use custom types or to face common value conversion needs, such as _enumeration_ property types mapped to integer or text data model types.

The Holon platform `Datastore` fully supports the new *Java 8 Date and Time API*, which represents a big step forward compared to the previous date and time support classes, to address the shortcomings of the older `java.util.Date` and `java.util.Calendar` types. It is strongly recommended to use the new `java.time.*` types for date and time properties, such as `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `LocalDateTime`.

When a `java.util.Date` or `java.util.Calendar` property type is used with `Datastore` API operations, it is recommended to configure the actual *temporal type* which is expected for the property, to ensure data consistency. This can be done through the <<PropertyConfiguration,property configuration>>.

[[DataTarget]]
==== DataTarget

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DataTarget.html[DataTarget^] interface is used by the `Datastore` API and the <<Query,Query definition API>> to refer to an _entity_ of the persistence model in an abstract and independent way from the concrete persistence layer. 

From the `DataTarget` point of view, an _entity_ has the meaning of a _collection of data model attributes_, and it is represented by a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/Path.html[Path^], i.e. by a symbolic *name*.

Examples of `DataTarget` representations are:

* The name of a _table_ in a RDBMS.
* The class of a JPA _entity_.
* The document _collection_ name in a document-oriented database.

Concrete `Datastore` implementations could provide more specialized `DataTarget` object types to identify a data model _entity_ which is specific of the persistence model to which the `Datastore` is bound.

The `DataTarget` interface provides static methods to create data targets using the default *name*  representation, optionally providing the `DataTarget` (`Path`) type:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=datatarget,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a default `String` type `DataTarget` named `test1`
<2> Create a `MyType` type `DataTarget` named `test2`

All the `Datastore` operations definition APIs involving persistent _entity_ structures use a `DataTarget` to identify the data model _entity_ to which the operation refers.

[[DataManipulationOperations]]
==== Data manipulation operations

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/Datastore.html[Datastore^] API provides the most common data manipulation operations, listed in the table below.

Each operation throws a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/exceptions/DataAccessException.html[DataAccessException^] if an error occurs during the operation execution.

Each operation (except for _refresh_) support configurable write *options*, represented by the `WriteOption` marker interface. Tipically, write options are specific of the underlying persistence model and each concrete `Datastore` implementation provides a set of suitable write options. See each specific `Datastore`  documentation for further information.

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DefaultWriteOption.html[DefaultWriteOption^] enumeration provides write options which can be available for any `Datastore` API. By now, a single default write option is defined:

*BRING_BACK_GENERATED_IDS*: Bring back any auto-generated id value into the `PropertyBox` which was subject of a data manipulation operation, if a corresponding `Property` (using the property name) is available in the `PropertyBox` property set. 

NOTE: Check specific `Datastore` implementations documentation to learn if this option is actually supported.

[[Query]]
=== Query

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/Query.html[Query^] API can be used to configure and execute _queries_ against the persistence data store.

Just like any other `Datastore` API operation, the `Query` API relies on the Holon platform <<Property,property model>> to represent the data model attributes and to obtain the query results, using a <<PropertyBox,PropertyBox>> to provide a set of property values.

This allows the query to be declared and executed in an abstract and implementation-independent way.

The `Query` API supports the following clauses and configuration attributes:

* The <<DataTarget>> on which the query has to be performed.
* A set of query *restrictions*, expressed as <<QueryFilter>> clauses.
* The query results *sorting* declarations, expressed as <<QuerySort>> clauses.
* The query results *aggregation*, expressed as <<QueryAggregation>> clauses.
* The query results *paging*, to configure the query result set _limit_ and _offset_.
* A set of generic query configuration *parameters*.

Below are described the standard query link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/Expression.html[Expression^]s made available by the Holon platform for the defintion of a query.

[[QueryFilter]]
==== QueryFilter

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFilter.html[QueryFilter^] interface represents a query results restriction `Expression`.

A `QueryFilter` acts on other _expressions_ which represent the restriction subject and conditions. Such expressions are typically a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/TypedExpression.html[TypedExpression^], i.e an `Expression` with explicitly declared type.

The most common restriction predicates representations are provided by the core platform classes. The following predicates are available:

* *Is null / is not null:* An expression is _null_ / not _null_.
* *equal / not equal:* An expression is equal / not equal to another expression.
* *less than / less than or equal:* An expression is less than / less than or equal to another expression.
* *greater than / greater than or equal:* An expression is greater than / greater than or equal to another expression.
* *between:* The value of an expression is included between a minimum and a maximum value.
* *in / not in:* The value of an expression is included / not included in a set of values.

For `String` type expressions:

* *contains:* The value of a `String` type expression contains a specified text (ignoring case or not).
* *startsWirth:* The value of a `String` type expression contains starts with a specified text (ignoring case or not).
* *endsWith:* The value of a `String` type expression contains ends with a specified text (ignoring case or not).

Furthermore, the `QueryFilter` predicates can be composed using logical operations:

* *not:* Negation of a `QueryFilter` predicate.
* *and:* Conjunction of `QueryFilter` predicates.
* *or:* Disjunction of `QueryFilter` predicates.

The `QueryFilter` predicates can be obtained in two ways:

*1.* Using the static builder methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFilter.html[QueryFilter^] interface.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=filter1,indent=0]
----
<1> Common restriction predicates using a `PathProperty` as expression
<2> `String` type expression restriction predicates
<3> Negation using either the `not()` `QueryFilter` method or the `not(QueryFilter filter)` builder method
<4> Conjunction (*AND*) using either the `and()` `QueryFilter` method or the `allOf(QueryFilter... filters)` builder method
<5> Disjunction (*OR*)  using either the `or()` `QueryFilter` method or the `anyOf(QueryFilter filter)` builder method

*2.* Using the convenience methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryExpression.html[QueryExpression^] interface. The `QueryExpression` API is implemented, for example, by the `PathProperty` interface.

The `QueryExpression` API makes available a set of methods to create a `QueryFilter` using the expression itself as the subject of the restriction predicate.

For restrictions which refers to a specific data type, specialized `QueryExpression` extensions should be used. For example, link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/StringQueryExpression.html[StringQueryExpression^] interface makes available methods to obtain String type restrictions, such a _contains_, _startsWith_, _endsWith_.
The type specific query expression APIs are implemented by each <<PathPropertySubTypes,PathProperty sub type>>: the `StringQueryExpression` API is implemented by the `StringProperty` type and so on.

<3> Logical operations 

[[QuerySort]]
==== QuerySort

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QuerySort.html[QuerySort^] interface represents a query results sorting directive.

A `QuerySort` acts on a generic `Path` expression to declare the sorting subject and uses the `SortDirection` enumeration to declare the sort direction (ascending or descending). Query sorts can be composed to declare an ordered list of sort declarations.

A `QuerySort` declaration can be obtained in two ways:

*1.*   Using the static builder methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QuerySort.html[QuerySort^] interface.

The `PathExpression` API makes available convenience methods to create a `QuerySort` using the expression itself (i.e. the `Path` represented by the expression) as the subject of the sort declaration.

----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=sort1,indent=0]

*2.* Using the convenience methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/PathExpression.html[PathExpression^] interface. The `PathExpression` API is implemented, for example, by the `PathProperty` interface.

The `PathExpression` API makes available convenience methods to create a `QuerySort` using the expression itself (i.e. the `Path` represented by the expression) as the subject of the sort declaration.

[source, java]

----
<1> Use the `asc()` and `desc()` `PathExpression` methods to create ascending and descending sorts
<2> The `and(QuerySort sort)` method of the `QuerySort` interface can be used to compose a list of sorts

[[QueryFunction]]
==== QueryFunction

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.html[QueryFunction^] interface represents a *function* expression.

A `QueryFunction` may accept a list of _arguments_, expressed as expressions themself. The `TypedExpression` type is used as query function arguments type, since a function could only be applicable to a specific argument type.

A set of common query functions is provided by the Holon platform, each represented by a specific `QueryFunction` sub type.

Common query functions can be obtained either using the `QueryFunction` static builder methods or using the convenience methods provided by APIs like link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryExpression.html[QueryExpression^]. In this second case, the expression itself is used as the query function argument.

===== Aggregation functions

* *Count*: Aggregation function to _count_ the number of available elements (for example the number of query results). Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Count.html[Count^] interface. Always returns a `Long` type result.
* *Min*: Aggregation function to obtain the _smallest value_ within a set of available elements. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Min.html[Min^] interface.
* *Max*: Aggregation function to obtain the _largest value_ within a set of available elements. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Max.html[Max^] interface.
* *Avg*: Aggregation function to obtain the _average value_ within a set of numeric elements. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Avg.html[Avg^] interface. Always returns a `Double` type result.
* *Sum*: Aggregation function to sum the values of a set of available elements. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Sum.html[Sum^] interface.

For agrregation functions which refers to a specific data type, specialized `QueryExpression` extensions should be used. For example, the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/NumericQueryExpression.html[NumericQueryExpression^] interface makes available methods to obtain *numeric* type restrictions, such a _avg_ and _sum_.
The type specific query expression APIs are implemented by each <<PathPropertySubTypes,PathProperty sub type>>: the `NumericQueryExpression` API is implemented by the `NumericProperty` type and so on.

[[StringRelatedFunctions]]
===== String related functions

For `String` type expressions, two standard query functions are made available by the Holon platform:

* *Lower*: Function to convert a string to _lowercase_. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Lower.html[Lower^] interface.
* *Upper*: Function to convert a string to _uppercase_. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFunction.Upper.html[Upper^] interface.

* *CurrentDate*: function to obtain the current date. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.CurrentDate.html[CurrentDate^] interface.
* *CurrentLocalDate*: function to obtain the current date as a `LocalDate`. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.CurrentLocalDate.html[CurrentLocalDate^] interface.
* *CurrentTimestamp*: function to obtain the current timestamp. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.CurrentTimestamp.html[CurrentTimestamp^] interface.
* *CurrentLocalDateTime*: function to obtain the current timestamp as a `LocalDateTime`. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.CurrentLocalDateTime.html[CurrentLocalDateTime^] interface.

* *Day*: function extract the _day_ part of a temporal data type. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.Day.html[Day^] interface. The day is intended as the day of month and the day range index is between 1 and 31.
* *Hour*: function extract the _hour_ part of a temporal data type. Represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/TemporalFunction.Hour.html[Hour^] interface. The 24-hour clock is used and the hour range index is between 0 and 23.

[[QueryAggregation]]
==== QueryAggregation

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryAggregation.html[QueryAggregation^] interface represents a query results _aggregation_ expression.

The `QueryAggregation` API allows to specify:

* The *paths* (using the `Path` type) to be used to aggregate the query results, i.e. to group the results by the values of the specified paths.
* The *optional restrictions* to apply on the aggregation path values, expressed by using <<QueryFilter>> predicates.

WARNING: Query results aggregation semantics can be slightly different from one `Datastore` implementation to another. Each `Datastore` implementation should ensure a consistent query execution behaviour, but in some situations it may not be possible to perform the aggregation operation for some query configurations. For example, many RDBMS engines do not allow to project a query result which is not part of the query aggregation clause unless an aggregation function is used.

The `QueryAggregation` API provides a buider to create and configure a query aggregation expression.

[[QueryDefinition]]
==== Query definition

A `Query` can be defined and configured using the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryBuilder.html[QueryBuilder^] interface.

The `QueryBuilder` provides methods to configure the query using the query *expressions* listed above. Furthermore, it provides methods to declare:

* The query *target*, which represents the data model _entity_ to be queried and is expressed through a <<DataTarget>>.
* The optional query results *pagination* declaration, which can be declared using:
** *limit:*: the query results limit, i.e. the max number of results to obtain.
** *offset:*: the 0-based offset from which to fetch the query results within the total results set.
* Optional query *parameters*, mainly used to for extension purposes.

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/Query.html[Query^] API extends `QueryBuilder`, and can be obtained from a `Datastore` using the `query()` method.

<8> Obtain a query builder and simultaneously set the query target
<9> Declare a query results aggregation clause using the `QueryAggregation` builder
<10> Set the the query pagination using the convenience `restrict` method, which accepts the query results limit and offset

[[QueryProjection]]
==== Query projection and execution

To obtain the `Query` results, a query results _projection_ must be declared. A projection is represented by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryProjection.html[QueryProjection^] interface and is used to declare which data model attribute values are to be returned and which type has to used to represent the query results.

The query results projection is provided at query execution time, using the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryResults.html[QueryResults^] API, which is implemented by the `Query` interface.

The main `QueryResults` API method to obtain the query results is `stream(QueryProjection<R> projection)`, which can be used to provide a `QueryProjection` and get the query execution result, which will be of the same type of the query projection type.

In addition to the default _stream_ method, a set of other convenience methods are provided by the `QueryResults` API for query execution and results retrieval:

* `list(QueryProjection<R> projection)`: To obtain the query results stream as a `List`.
* `findOne(QueryProjection<R> projection)`: To obtain a result which is expected to be *unique*, if it is available. The query result is provided as an `Optional` and if more than one result is obtained from query execution, a `QueryNonUniqueResultException` is thrown.
* `count()`: To count all the query results, returing the number of results as a `long`.

Furthermore, a set of convenience methods are provided to use the Holon platform <<Property,properties>> abstration as query projection and to obtain the query results using the <<PropertyBox,PropertyBox>> type:

* `stream(Iterable<P> properties)` and `stream(Property... properties)`: Allows to provide one or more `Property` as query projection and obtain the query results as a stream of `PropertyBox`. The _list_ version is also available to obtain the query results as a `List` instead of a `Stream`.
* `findOne(Iterable<P> properties)` and `findOne(Property... properties)`: Allows to provide one or more `Property` as query projection and obtain a query result which is expected to be *unique* as a `PropertyBox`.  The query result is provided as an `Optional` and if more than one result is obtained from query execution, a `QueryNonUniqueResultException` is thrown.

[source, java]

<1> Count the query results
<2> Use the `PROPERTY1` as query projection and obtain the query results as a `Stream` of values of the property value type (`Integer`)
<3> Use the `PROPERTY1` as query projection expecting a unique result, obtaining the query result as an `Optional` value of the property value type (`Integer`)
<4> When more than one `Property` is provided as query projection, the query results are obtained as a `Stream` of `PropertyBox` instances
<5> A `PropertySet` can be used to provide a multiple `Property` query projection
<6> The same operation can be performed with the `list` method, obtaining the query results as a `List`
<7> `PROPERTY1` and `PROPERTY2` are provided as query projection and a unique result is expected: the query result is obtained as an `Optional` `PropertyBox` instance

[[BuiltinQueryProjections]]
===== Builtin query projections

The Holon platform core module provides some builtin `QueryProjection` types which can be used for query execution.

As seen in the previous section, a `PathProperty` is a `QueryProjection` itself, and can be directly used as query projection. When the query projection must include more than one property, the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/PropertySetProjection.html[PropertySetProjection^] type can be used. Anyway, is easier to use the appropriate `QueryResults` API methods to directly provide a set of properties or a `PropertySet` as query projection.

The other builtin query projections are:

*1. QueryFunction:* 

A <<QueryFunction>> can be directly used as query projection. The projection result type will be the same as the `QueryFunction` result type.

<2> Use the `Upper` function  on `PROPERTY2` to obtain a stream of `String` values applying the uppercase transformation

*2. Constant expression:* 

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/ConstantExpressionProjection.html[ConstantExpressionProjection^] type can be used to declare a *costant expression value* as query projection.

*3. Bean projection:*

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/BeanProjection.html[BeanProjection^] interface can be used to obtain the query results as Java Bean class instances, providing the *bean class* to be used. 

Optionally, the projection `Path` names can be specified to control the bean property set which as to be obtained as query result. If not specified, all the bean definition class properties will be used as query projection paths.

<2> The same operation but expecting a unique result, which will be returned as an `Optional` `MyBean` instance
<3> Use `MyBean` class as query projection and specify the query projection paths. In this example, only the `code` bean property is declared as projection paths, so only the `code` property values will be retrieved from query execution and setted in the `MyBean` result instances

*3. Select all projection:*

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/SelectAllProjection.html[SelectAllProjection^] interface can be used to obtain all the values of a persistent data entity instance as a `Map` with the entity attribute _names_ as keys and the corresponding entity attribute _values_ as values.

The concrete result can be highly dependent on the specific `Datastore` implementation, both regarding the entity attribute names and the entity attribute values representations.

[[DatastoreConfiguration]]
==== Configuration

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DatastoreConfigProperties.html[DatastoreConfigProperties^] interface represents and provides the available configuration properties which can be used to configure a generic `Datastore` instance.

The interface extends the default `ConfigPropertySet` API, bound to the property name prefix *holon.datastore*.

The available configuration properties are listed below:

.Datastore configuration properties
|===
|Name |Type |Meaning

|_holon.datastore._ *trace*
|Boolean (`true` / `false`)
|Enable/disable `Datastore` operations tracing in log
|_holon.datastore._ *dialect*
|String
|The fully qualified class name of the _dialect_ to be used by the `Datastore`. The _dialect_ semantics and the available implementations are specific for each `Datastore` implementation. See each specific `Datastore` implementation documentation for information.
|===

The `DatastoreConfigProperties` can be loaded from a number of sources using the default `ConfigPropertySet` builder interface:

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=config,indent=0]
----
<1> Read the configuration properties from _default_ property sources (i.e. the `holon.properties` file)
<2> Read the configuration properties from `System` properties
<3> Read the configuration properties from a `Properties` instance
<4> Read the configuration properties from the `datastore.properties` file

[[DatastoreDataContextId]]
===== Multiple Datastores configuration

When multiple `Datastore` configuration is required and properties are read from the same source, a _data context id_ can be used to discern one `Datastore` configuration property set from another.

From the property source point of view, the _data context id_ is used as a *suffix* after the configuration property set name (`holon.datastore`) and before the specific property name.

For example, let's say we have a configuration property set for two different datastores as follows:

[source, text]
----
holon.datastore.one.trace=true

holon.datastore.two.trace=false
----

In order to provide the configuration for two `Datastore` instances, one bound to the `one` configuration property set and the other bound to the `two` configuration property set, the `DatastoreConfigProperties` can be obtained as follows, specifying the _data context id_ when obtaining the builder:

[[RelationalDatastores]]
==== Relational Datastores

When a `Datastore` implementation refers to a *relational* persistence data model, some additional expressions  are provided to use typical _relational_ concepts concerning query definition and execution.

[[subquery]]
===== Sub-query

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/relational/SubQuery.html[SubQuery^] interface can be used to represent a _sub-query_,  which can be used in a query definition to express query restrictions (filters) that involve a sub-query as filter operand.

To create a `SubQuery`, the `create(...)` static methods of the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/relational/SubQuery.html[SubQuery^] interface can be used. 

Since `SubQuery` extends link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryBuilder.html[QueryBuilder^], a sub query cna be configured (setting the query target, restrictions, sorting and so on) the same way as a standard `Query`. 

The `SubQuery` projection is provided to the `create(...)` builder methods at sub query definition time.

A `SubQuery` is a `QueryExpression`, allowing to use it as a `QueryFilter` operand.

IMPORTANT: When a `SubQuery` is used in a query, to avoid property/column names ambiguity, it is strongly recommended to provide a *parent* `DataTarget` for the query properties. The parent `DataTarget` of a `Property` can be setted using the `parent(...)` method of the property builder or directly using the `property(...)` methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DataTarget.html[DataTarget^] interface to create a `Property` with the given `DataTarget` as parent.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=subquery1,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a `SubQuery`
<2> Use the `SubQuery` as the right operand of a `IN` query filter

Two convenience methods are provided by the `SubQuery` interface to create *EXISTS* and *NOT EXISTS* filter predicates. In this case, the sub-query selection projection is not required, since the `1` literal value is used by default as projection.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=subquery2,indent=0]
----
<1> A query with a filter using a *EXISTS* `SubQuery` predicate
<2> A query with a filter using a *NOT EXISTS* `SubQuery` predicate

[[joins]]
===== Alias and Joins

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/relational/RelationalTarget.html[RelationalTarget^] interface can be used to declare and *alias* and to configure *joins* for a `DataTarget`.

A `RelationalTarget` is a `DataTarget` itself, and provides methods to assign an *alias* name to the query target and to create *joins* with other targets.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=alias,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a `RelationalTarget` using given `TARGET`
<2> Create a new `RelationalTarget` from the previous one, assigning an alias name to it

The following join types are supported:

* *INNER JOIN*: returns all rows when there is at least one match in BOTH tables represented by the source `DataTarget` and the joined `DataTarget`;
* *LEFT JOIN*: returns all rows from the left table (represented by the source `DataTarget`), and the matched rows from the right table (represented by the joined `DataTarget`);
* *RIGHT JOIN*: returns all rows from the right table (represented by the joined `DataTarget`), and the matched rows from the left table (represented by the source `DataTarget`);

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/relational/Join.html[Join^] interface represents the join expression, supporting an *alias* name definition and a *ON* clause definition, to express any join restriction/filter predicate.

A `RelationalTarget` is created from a conventional `DataTarget` using the `of(DataTarget target)` static method.

IMPORTANT: When joins are used in a query, to avoid property/column names ambiguity, it is strongly recommended to provide a *parent* `DataTarget` for the query properties. The parent `DataTarget` of a `Property` can be setted using the `parent(...)` method of the property builder or directly using the `property(...)` methods provided by the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DataTarget.html[DataTarget^] interface to create a `Property` with the given `DataTarget` as parent.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleQuery.java[tag=joins,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a `RelationalTarget` using `TARGET1`
<2> Join (using a *INNER* join type) the `TARGET1` with the `TARGET2`, using a *ON* clause to express the join condition
<3> Join (using a *INNER* join type) the `TARGET1` with the `TARGET2`, using a *ON* clause to express the join condition
<4> Join (using a *LEFT* join type) the `TARGET1` with the `TARGET2`, using a *ON* clause to express the join condition
<5> Join (using a *RIGHT* join type) the `TARGET1` with the `TARGET2`, using a *ON* clause to express the join condition
<6> Use the created `RelationalTarget` as a query target

[[TransactionalDatastores]]
==== Transactional Datastores

If a `Datastore` implementation supports *transactions*, the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/Transactional.html[Transactional^] API can be used to manage the transactions at a higher level, in an abstract and implementation-independent way.

The `Transactional` API makes available method to execute a `Datastore` operation within a transaction, taking care of the transaction lifecycle.

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/TransactionalOperation.html[TransactionalOperation^] functional interface has to used to perform actual operation execution and to handle the current transaction, represented by a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/Transaction.html[Transaction^] reference, for example to perform transaction *commit* or *rollback*.

The `Datastore` API provides a `isTransactional()` method which can be used to check if the concrete `Datastore` implementation supports transaction and to obtain it as a `Transactional` API reference. The `requireTransactional()` method has the same meaning, but throws an exception if the concrete `Datastore` implementation does not support transactions.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=transactional1,indent=0]
----
<1> Check if `Datastore` is transactional: if so, obtain the `Transactional` API reference
<2> Execute on operation within a transaction and return a `OperationResult` type result
<3> Execute the actual operation
<4> Commit the transaction

When a return value is not needed, the `TransactionalInvocation` interface can be used instead of the standard `TransactionalOperation` one.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=transactional2,indent=0]
----
<1> Require the `Datastore` to be transactional and obtain the `Transactional` API reference
<2> Execute on operation within a transaction which do not returns any result
<3> Execute the actual operation
<4> Commit the transaction

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/Transaction.html[Transaction^] interface allows also to set the transaction as *rollback only*, so that the only possible outcome of the transaction is for the transaction to be rolled back.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=transactional3,indent=0]
----
<1> Set the transaction as rollback only

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/TransactionConfiguration.html[TransactionConfiguration^] API can be used to *configure the transaction*.

The transaction configuration options are:

* Set the *auto-commit* mode: whether the transaction must be committed when a transactional operation ends and no error occurred. Default is `false`.
* Set the *rollback on error* mode: whether the transaction must be rolled back when an exception is thrown during a transactional operation execution. Default is `true`.
* Configure the *transaction options*, if supported by the concrete `Datastore` implementation

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=transactional4,indent=0]
----
<1> Configure the transaction enabling the auto-commit mode

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=transactional5,indent=0]
----
<1> Configure the transaction disabling the _rollback on error_ behaviour and the auto-commit mode

===== Obtain a Transaction reference

When using the `withTransaction` methods, the transaction lifecycle is managed by the `Datastore`, ensuring transaction finalization at the end of the transactional operation.

A `Transaction` can also be obtained using the `getTransaction` method of the `Transactional` API. This method starts a transaction and returns it to the caller, but the `Transaction` lifecycle is now delegated to the caller itself, which *must ensure to finalize the transaction calling either the `commit` or `rollback` transaction methods*.

The `Transaction` obtained this way is bound to the current Thread, and any `Datastore` operation executed in the same Thread after the transaction is started will use such transaction.

IMPORTANT: The *auto-commit* mode which can be configured through the `TransactionalConfiguration` API *has no effect* when a `Transaction` is obtained using the `getTransaction` methods, because the transaction lifecycle management is delegated to the caller.

<1> Obtain and start a `Transaction`
<2> Commit the transaction

[[DatastoreExtension]]
==== Datastore API extensions

Datastores provides two main entry points for extension purposes:

* Use the `Expression` based architecture, through the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/ExpressionResolver.html[ExpressionResolver^] interface, to provide custom expressions and the expression resolution logic which is required to _resolve_ such expressions in a form that the `Datastore` is able to understand.

* Provide additional `Datastore` operations and functionalities relying on the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DatastoreCommodity.html[DatastoreCommodity^] concept, through the registration of a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DatastoreCommodityFactory.html[DatastoreCommodityFactory^].

[[DatastoreExpressionResolverExtension]]
===== Extend the Datastore API using `ExpressionResolver`

The `Datastore` API supports `ExpressionResolver` registration, to add new expression resolution strategies and to handle new `Expression` types.

In a general sense, any new expression type should be resolved in an expression type that the `Datastore` is able to understand.

Each concrete `Datastore` implementation could provide additional expression types and specific expression resolution capabilities. See each `Datastore` implementation documentation to learn about any additional extension capability which could be provide by a specific `Datastore` implementation.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=resolver,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a custom `QuerySort` expression class
<2> Create an `ExpressionResolver` to resolve the `MyExpression` type into a standard `QuerySort` type
<3> Register the `ExpressionResolver` in the `Datastore`
<4> Use the `MyExpression` type as any other `QuerySort` expression

For the most common query expressions, convenience `ExpressionResolver` types are provided to easily create expression resolution extensions. See below for the available core `ExpressionResolver` extensions.

[[DataTargetResolver]]
===== DataTargetResolver

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DataTarget.DataTargetResolver.html[DataTargetResolver^] is a convenience `ExpressionResolver` extension to resolve <<DataTarget>> type expressions.

Tipically, a `DataTargetResolver` can be defined to resolve a `DataTarget` with a symbolic name into a specific Datastore data target.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleDatastore.java[tag=datatargetresolver,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a resolver which translates the symbolic `test` data target name into another named target with the `wellKnownTargetName` name

[[QueryFilterResolver]]
===== QueryFilterResolver

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryFilter.QueryFilterResolver.html[QueryFilterResolver^] interface is a convenience `ExpressionResolver` extension to resolve <<QueryFilter>> type expressions.

A typical custom `QueryFilter` expression definition process takes place with the following steps:

. First af all, you have to define your custom filter representation, providing a class which implements the `QueryFilter` interface (and, optionally, an interface which extends `QueryFilter` and represents your custom filter API);
. Then create a class which implements `QueryFilterResolver`, generalized on your custom filter class/interface, whose purpose is to resolve the custom filter, transforming it into a `QueryFilter` that can be handled by the concrete `Datastore`.
. Finally, register the `QueryFilterResolver` in the `Datastore` instance, using the `addExpressionResolver(...)` method.

When the resolver is registered, the custom filter can be used as any another `QueryFilter` implementation.

----
<1> Custom filter definition, implementing `QueryFilter`
<2> Custom filter resolver class

<4> The resolver is registered in the `Datastore`, enabling the use of the `MyFilter` type filter in query and bulk operations clauses
<5> Use of a `MyFilter` in a query execution 

[[QuerySortResolver]]
===== QuerySortResolver

The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QuerySort.QuerySortResolver.html[QuerySortResolver^] interface is a convenience `ExpressionResolver` extension to resolve <<QuerySort>> type expressions.

A typical custom `QuerySort` expression definition process takes place with the following steps:

. First af all, you have to define your custom sort representation, providing a class wich implements the `QuerySort` interface (and, optionally, an interface which extends `QuerySort` and represents your custom filter API);
. Then create a class which implements `QuerySortResolver`, generalized on your custom sort class/interface, whose purpose is to resolve the custom sort, transforming it into a `QuerySort` declaration which the concrete `Datastore` can handle. 
. Finally, register the `QuerySortResolver` in the `Datastore` instance, using the `addExpressionResolver(...)` method.

When the resolver is registered, the custom sort can be used as any another `QuerySort` implementation.

<4> The resolver is registered in the `Datastore`, enabling the use of the `MySort` type sort in query clauses
<5> Use of a `MySort` in a query execution

[[DatastoreCommodities]]
===== Datastore _commodities_ definition and registration

Using the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DatastoreCommodity.html[DatastoreCommodity^] representation, a `Datastore` can be extended by adding new operations and functionalities, represented by a class which implements the `DatastoreCommodity` interface.

A `DatastoreCommodity` must be provided using a link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/DatastoreCommodityFactory.html[DatastoreCommodityFactory^] implementation, which has to be registered in the target `Datastore` through the `registerCommodity(DatastoreCommodityFactory<X, C> commodityFactory)` method.

NOTE: Concrete `Datastore` implementations may provide other methods to register a commodity. See each specific `Datastore` implementation documentation for details.

Each commodity factory is bound to a specific `DatastoreCommodity` type, provided by the `getCommodityType()` factory method, and can use a `DatastoreCommodityContext` to create and configure the commodity instance when requested. 

NOTE: Concrete `Datastore` implementations may offer specific `DatastoreCommodityContext` extensions to provide specific `Datastore` context references and configuration attributes.

A `DatastoreCommodity` can be obtained from a `Datastore` using the `create(Class<C> commodityType)` method. A `DatastoreCommodityFactory` bound to the requested commodity type must be available, i.e. previuosly registered in `Datastore`, in order to obtain the commodity instance.

See each concrete `Datastore` implementations documentation for further details and examples.

==== Available Datastores

By now, the holon platform provides two default `Datastore` implementations:

* link:../../holon-jdbc/overview.html[JDBC Datastore]: using the *Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)* specification to access a relational database
* link:../../holon-jpa/overview.html[JPA Datastore]: using the *Java Persistence API* specification to access a relational database
