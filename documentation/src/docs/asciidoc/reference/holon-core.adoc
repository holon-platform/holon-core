== Introduction

The Holon Platform *Core* module represents the platform foundation, providing the definition of the overall architecture, base structures and APIs.

=== Sources and contributions

The Holon Platform *Core* module source code is available from the GitHub repository link:https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-core[https://github.com/holon-platform/holon-core^].

See the repository `README` file for information about:

* The source code structure.
* How to build the module artifacts from sources.
* Where to find the code examples.
* How to contribute to the module development.

== Obtaining the artifacts

The Holon Platform uses https://maven.apache.org[Maven^] for projects build and configuration. All the platform artifacts are published in the *Maven Central Repository*, so there is no need to explicitly declare additional repositories in your project `pom` file.

At the top of each _section_ of this documentation you will find the Maven _coordinates_ (group id, artifact id and version) to obtain the artifact(s) as a dependency for your project.

A *BOM (Bill Of Materials)* `pom` is provided to import the available dependencies for a specific version in your projects. The Maven coordinates for the core BOM are the following:

_Maven coordinates_:
[source, xml, subs="attributes+"]
----
<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
<artifactId>holon-bom</artifactId>
<version>{revnumber}</version>
----

The BOM can be imported in a Maven project in the following way:

[source, xml, subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes+"]
----
<dependencyManagement>
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.holon-platform.core</groupId>
			<artifactId>holon-bom</artifactId>
			<version>{revnumber}</version>
			*<type>pom</type>*
			*<scope>import</scope>*
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

=== Using the Platform BOM

The Holon Platform provides an *overall Maven BOM (Bill of Materials)* to easily obtain all the available platform artifacts.

See link:index.html#obtain-the-platform-artifacts[Obtain the platform artifacts] for details.

[[WhatsNew52x]]
== What's new in version 5.2.x

* *JDK 9+ module support*:
Support for JDK 9+ module system using `Automatic-Module-Name`.

*  *AsyncDatastore*:
The new `holon-async-datastore` artifact was introduced to provide a core link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/async/datastore/AsyncDatastore.html[AsyncDatastore^] API. The `AsyncDatastore` API provides asynchronous Datastore API operations, using the standard JVN `CompletionStage` type to provide the operations result. See <<AvailableDatastores>> to check the specific `AsyncDatastore` support.

*  *AsyncRestClient*:
The new `holon-async-http` artifact was introduced to provide a core link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/async/http/AsyncRestClient.html[AsyncRestClient^] API. The `AsyncRestClient` API provides asynchronous REST client API operations, using the standard JVN `CompletionStage` type to provide the operations result.

* *Property model*:
The new link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/property/CollectionProperty.html[CollectionProperty^] interface was introduced to provide specific `Collection` type `Property` values, specifically using the standard `Set` and `List` collection types. See <<CollectionProperties>>.

* *QueryConfigurationProvider builder*:
A fluent builder is now available for the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryConfigurationProvider.html[QueryConfigurationProvider^] API. The builder can be obtained using the `builder()` static method.

* *Datastore Query distinct support*:
The new `distinct()` link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/QueryBuilder.html[QueryBuilder^] method can be used to obtain _distinct_ query projection result values. See <<QueryDistinct>>.

* *Datastore Query select all projection*:
A new link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/SelectAllProjection.html[SelectAllProjection^] is now available to obtain all the values af a persistent data entity instance using the `Datastore` query API. See <<BuiltinQueryProjections>>.

* *Datastore Query locks*:
The new link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/lock/LockQuery.html[LockQuery^] API is a `Datastore` query extension to provide database lock support, through the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/query/lock/LockSupport.html[LockSupport^]. Currently, only the _pessimistic_ lock mode is supported. For the query lock support availability, see the specific `Datastore` implementations documentation.

* *@EnableDatastoreConfiguration annotation*:
The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/spring/EnableDatastoreConfiguration.html[EnableDatastoreConfiguration^] annotation can be used on Spring configuration classes to enable a post processor for automatic `Datastore` Spring bean types configuration. See <<EnableDatastoreConfiguration>>.

* The Holon Platform *Spring* and *Spring Boot* support is now targeted on the version *5.x* and *2.1.x* respectively.

[[MigratingFrom51x]]
=== Migrating from version 5.1.x

==== API changes

* *Transaction API*: 
The link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/TransactionConfiguration.html[TransactionConfiguration^] API was made more abstract and implementation independent, using the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/TransactionOptions.html[TransactionOptions^] interface to represent transaction configuration options. The `TransactionOptions` has to be extended by concrete implementations to represent and provide the supported transaction configuration attributes.
For this reason, the `com.holonplatform.core.datastore.transaction.TransactionIsolation` enumeration was moved to the *holon-jdbc* module.

Furthermore, the `TransactionException` class hierarchy was moved from the link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/Transaction.html[Transaction^] interface to the new {apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/transaction/TransactionStatus.html[TransactionStatus^] interface, which represents a base transaction definition, shared with the asynchronous Datastore implementations.

[[WhatsNew51x]]
== What's new in version 5.1.x

=== Property model

* The `Property` instance identification strategy can now be customized using specific _equals_ and _hashCode_ handlers. See <<PropertyIdentity>>.

* The `PathProperty` interface now provides a set of sub types, to consistently handle property _expressions_ which are type specific, for the main Java types (*String*, *Numbers*, *Temporal types* and *Boolean*). See <<PathPropertySubTypes>>.

* The `PropertySet` interface now supports a generic *configuration* container, likewise the `Property` interface. See <<PropertySetConfiguration>>.

* The `PropertySet` interface now supports _identifier_ properties declaration, which can be used to provide a virtual primary key to distinguish a `PropertyBox` instance from another (using the _identifier_ property values), both at Java objects level (`equals` and `hashCode`) and at persistence architecture level. See <<IdentifierProperties>>.

* Just like the `Property` instances, the `PropertyBox` instances identification strategy can now be customized using specific _equals_ and _hashCode_ handlers. Furthermore, if the `PropertyBox` property set declares one or more _identifier_ property, their values will be used by default to implement the `PropertyBox` instance identification strategy. See <<PropertyBoxIdentification>>.

* The new <<BeanPropertySetPostProcessor>> interface can be used to extend the <<BeanIntrospector>> Bean introspection strategy at Bean property set level, allowing for example to customize the Bean property set configuration. See <<BeanPropertySetPostProcessor>>.

* The <<BeanDataPath,@DataPath>> annotation can be used on Bean classes to declare a *data path mapping* name different form the Bean class or property name, when the Bean class is used in a persistence context and it is bound to a data model definition. See <<BeanDataPath>>.

=== Datastore

* A deep revision of the `Expression` based architecture, which is the foundation, above all, of the `Datastore` API and the abstract `Query` engine. This lead to a more consistent and extensible architecture, along with considerable performance improvements. See the <<Query>> and <<DatastoreExtension>> sections of the `Datastore` documentation.

* New standard `QueryFunction` implementations was made available for the core `Datastore` API. Besides <<StringRelatedFunctions,String related functions>>, a set of *temporal* data types related functions is now available to obtain current date/time (with `java.time.*` types support) and to extract a temporal part (_year_, _month_, _day_, _hour_). See <<TemporalFunctions>>.

* A new `Transactional` API which can be used when a `Datastore` implementation supports *transactions*, which can be managed at a higher level, in an abstract and implementation-independent way. The `Transactional` API allows to execute `Datastore` operations whithin a transaction, taking care of the transaction lifecycle and providing transaction reference to perform _commit_ and _rollback_ operations. See <<TransactionalDatastores>>.

* New `DataMappable` API to represent data model _mappings_. See <<DataMappable>>.

=== JWT authentication

* The JWT configuration now supports a wider range of key sources, formats (such as the `PKCS#12` key store format) and encodings (such as the `PEM` encoding) for private and public key declarations when an asymmetric signing algorithm is used. See <<JwtConfiguration,JWT configuration>>.

=== Spring ecosystem integration

* The `TenantScopeManager` API is now available to manage the _tenant_ scoped beans lifecycle. See <<TenantScopeManager>>.

* The new `holon-spring-security` artifact provides integration between the Holon Platform authentication and authorization architecture and the *Spring Security* one. Furthermore, a `holon-starter-security` Spring Boot starter is now available for quick project setup. See <<SpringSecurity>>.

[[MigratingFrom50x]]
=== Migrating from version 5.0.x

==== Deprecations

* *PropertySet API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/property/PropertySet.html#join-com.holonplatform.core.property.PropertySet...-[join^]. Using this method causes the loss of any property set configuration and/or identifier property declaration. Use the default <<PropertySet,PropertySet>> builder instead.
* *BeanPropertySet API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanPropertySet.html#create-java.lang.Class-com.holonplatform.core.Path-[create providing a parent path^]. The bean properties _parent path_ will always be the `FinalPath` which represents the Bean class, with the bean fully qualified class name as path name. Use the default `create(Class<? extends T> beanClass)` method instead. The same considerations are valid for the `getPropertySet` method of the <<BeanIntrospector,BeanIntrospector>> API.
* *BeanPropertySet/BeanPropertyInspector API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/beans/BeanPropertyInspector.html#requireProperty-java.lang.String-[requireProperty^] methods. The methods name are changed in `property` for consistency with the naming conventions of the new `BeanPropertyInspector` API.
* *SubQuery API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/core/datastore/relational/SubQuery.html#create-com.holonplatform.core.datastore.Datastore-java.lang.Class-[creation methods providing a Datastore^]. The `Datastore` parameter is no longer required. Use the new `create(...)` method versions which does not require the `Datastore` parameter.
* *JwtConfigProperties API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/auth/jwt/JwtConfigProperties.html[private and public key source configuration properties^]. The private and public key sources can now be specified using the `publickey.source` property and using the `file:` and `classpath:` prefixes to declare the source type.
* *JwtTokenBuilder API*: link:{apidir}/com/holonplatform/auth/jwt/JwtTokenBuilder.html#buildJwtToken-com.holonplatform.auth.jwt.JwtConfiguration-com.holonplatform.auth.Authentication-java.lang.String-[static token creation method]. The `JwtTokenBuilder` is now an interface. The default implementation can be obtained using the `get()` static method.

==== Property model

With the introduction of the <<PathPropertySubTypes,PathProperty sub types>>, a `PathProperty` declaration should be made using the most suitable sub type, if available.

This is also necessary to use the convenience `QueryFilter` and `QueryFunction` static builder methods to create an expression using the property itself. The expression builder methods are now *organized by sub type*, so, for example, the `contains` method is only available for `String` type properties and the `StringProperty` sub type should by used in this case.

[source, java]
----
include::{examplesdir}/com/holonplatform/core/examples/ExampleProperty.java[tag=subtypes1,indent=0]
----
<1> Create a `StringProperty` path property type with the `name` path name
<2> The `StringProperty` type makes available convenience expression builder methods according to the `String` property type, for example `contains`

== Loggers

By default, the Holon platform uses the https://www.slf4j.org[SLF4J^] API for logging. The use of SLF4J is optional: it is enabled when the presence of SLF4J is detected in the classpath. Otherwise, logging will fall back to JUL (`java.util.logging`).

The following logger names are available:

* `com.holonplatform.core`: the root *core* logger
** `presentation`: for logs related to values presentation
** `i18n`: for logs related to localization and internationalization
** `beans`: for logs related to bean inspection and bean properties
** `property`: for logs related to the `Property` architecture, including `PropertyBox`, property presenters and renderers
** `query`: for logs related to `Query` definition and execution
** `datastore`: for logs related to `Datastore` configuration and operation execution
* `com.holonplatform.jdbc`: for logs related to *JDBC* support classes, such as DataSource builders
* `com.holonplatform.http`: for logs related to *HTTP* support classes, such as `RestClient`
* `com.holonplatform.spring`: for logs related to https://spring.io[Spring^] integration

== System requirements

=== Java

The Holon Platform core module requires https://www.java.com[Java] *8* or higher.
